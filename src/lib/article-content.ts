There is a persistent myth in property development that the real risk is in construction. Blowouts. Delays. Subcontractors who disappear. And yes, those things happen. But in our experience assessing sites across the Sunshine Coast, the costliest mistakes almost always happen earlier. Before a single footing is poured.

They happen when someone buys a site based on a hunch. When the zoning looks right on a quick search but nobody checks the overlay map. When the numbers get modelled on assumptions pulled from a different suburb, a different market cycle, or a different product type entirely.

## The $50,000 mistake nobody talks about

Here is a scenario we see regularly. A developer identifies a site in a medium density residential zone. The price seems reasonable. They engage a planner, who confirms multiple dwellings are permissible. They engage an architect, who produces a concept for six townhouses. They engage a QS, who estimates construction at $2.4 million.

Three months and $40,000 in consultant fees later, they lodge a DA. Council comes back with information requests about flood mapping, stormwater management, and insufficient setbacks to the rear boundary. The architect redesigns. The planner rewrites. Four of the six townhouses become three. The numbers no longer work, but the deposit on the land is non-refundable.

This is not an edge case. It is the most common pattern we see.

## Why the feasibility stage is where the real money is made or lost

The period before commitment is the only time you have full optionality. You can walk away. You can negotiate the land price down. You can adjust the product type. You can model different scenarios.

Once you have committed capital (a deposit, a consultant engagement, a DA lodgement), every decision gets more expensive. Your negotiating position weakens. Your sunk costs accumulate. Your timeline starts working against you.

A rigorous feasibility assessment at this stage does not just tell you whether a project is viable. It tells you exactly what would need to be true for it to work. What the maximum land price should be. What product type the market will absorb. What the council is likely to require. What the construction cost envelope looks like given the site constraints.

## What good feasibility analysis actually looks like

Too many feasibility assessments are just spreadsheets with optimistic assumptions. They model one scenario, use generic cost rates, and do not interrogate the planning controls properly.

A proper assessment integrates three disciplines that are normally siloed: planning, architecture, and financial analysis. It cross-references the planning scheme overlays with the site geometry to understand what can actually be built, not just what the zoning permits in theory. It benchmarks construction costs against comparable local projects, not national averages. It models revenue against actual sales data for the specific suburb and product type.

This is what we built Casa Intelligence to do. Our system pre-processes hundreds of data points for every site before an analyst even begins their review. The result is a feasibility assessment that takes five to seven business days instead of eight weeks, costs a fraction of the traditional approach, and is significantly more accurate because it is data-driven rather than assumption-driven.

## The developers who win are the ones who know when to walk away

The best developers we work with do not just use feasibility to greenlight projects. They use it to kill bad ones early. They would rather spend $8,000 on a feasibility report that says "do not proceed" than spend $80,000 discovering the same thing six months later.

That discipline is what separates the developers who build wealth from the ones who build headaches. And it starts with getting the pre-development phase right.

If you are looking at a site on the Sunshine Coast and you are not sure whether the numbers stack up, that uncertainty is itself a signal. Get the data before you commit the capital.

'sunshine-coast-planning-scheme-what-developers-miss': `
The Sunshine Coast Planning Scheme 2014 (as amended) is a 3,000+ page document that governs what can and cannot be built on every parcel in the local government area. Most developers never read past the zoning map. That is where problems start.

Zoning is the starting point, not the answer. A site zoned Medium Density Residential does not mean you can build medium density housing. It means medium density housing is contemplated in that zone, subject to a cascade of additional controls that can dramatically affect what is actually achievable.

## The overlay problem

Overlays are the silent killers of development margins on the Sunshine Coast. The planning scheme includes overlays for flooding, bushfire, landslide, acid sulfate soils, heritage, building height, scenic amenity, and several others. A single site can be affected by multiple overlays simultaneously.

Each overlay introduces its own set of requirements: additional setbacks, material specifications, engineering reports, ecological assessments, or outright prohibitions on certain types of development. The costs compound. A site with a flood overlay and a bushfire overlay might require an additional $80,000 to $120,000 in reports, design modifications, and construction upgrades before you even account for the base development costs.

The problem is that overlays are not always obvious from a desktop review. Some require specific GIS queries against state government databases. Some have provisions buried in the planning scheme's overlay codes that only become apparent when you read the detailed assessment criteria.

## Local plans and precincts add another layer

The Sunshine Coast Planning Scheme includes local plans for specific areas: Caloundra South, Maroochydore, Mooloolaba, and others. These local plans override or supplement the general zone provisions, and they often include precinct-specific requirements that are more restrictive than what the zone code alone would suggest.

A site in the Maroochydore local plan area might have a completely different height limit, setback requirement, and density expectation compared to an identically zoned site five kilometres away. Developers who do not check for local plan provisions are working with incomplete information.

## Code assessable does not mean guaranteed approval

A common misunderstanding is that code assessable development is automatically approved. It is not. Code assessable means the application is assessed against the relevant codes (zone code, overlay codes, development codes) without public notification. But the application still needs to comply with or be able to demonstrate compliance with every applicable provision.

If a proposed development does not meet a code requirement, the applicant needs to demonstrate that an alternative solution achieves the purpose of the code. This is where detailed planning knowledge becomes essential, because the difference between a compliant application and one that triggers information requests often comes down to how the application addresses specific assessment benchmarks.

## What this means for your next site acquisition

Before you commit to a site, you need to know: what zone applies, what overlays affect the site, whether a local plan applies, what the specific assessment criteria are for your proposed use, and what the likely council response will be based on recent decision patterns.

This is not a ten-minute job. For a thorough assessment, it requires cross-referencing multiple layers of the planning scheme, querying state government spatial databases, and understanding the practical interpretation that Sunshine Coast Council applies to its own planning instrument.

This is exactly what our intelligence system does. We pre-process every site against the full suite of planning controls before our analysts begin their assessment. The result is a feasibility report that accounts for planning risk in a way that most generic assessments do not.

'queensland-development-feasibility-what-the-numbers-need-to-show': `
When most people think about a development feasibility study, they think about one number: the profit margin. Is it 15%? 20%? 25%? And while margin matters, it is one of the least useful numbers in isolation. A 20% margin on a project with a 24-month timeline, three critical overlays, and a council that takes nine months to assess DAs is a very different proposition to a 20% margin on a clean site with code assessable approval.

The real question a feasibility study needs to answer is not "is this profitable?" but "is this worth the risk, the capital, and the time?"

## The numbers that actually matter

Beyond the headline margin, here is what a useful feasibility study should quantify:

**Return on cost, not just margin.** Margin measures profit as a percentage of revenue. Return on cost measures profit relative to what you actually spent. On a project where 70% of costs are front-loaded (land purchase, DA, civil works), the return on cost tells you how efficiently your capital is working.

**Sensitivity to construction cost variance.** Construction costs on the Sunshine Coast have moved significantly over the past three years. A feasibility that models a single cost point is not a feasibility. It is a guess. You need to see what happens to your margin when construction comes in 10% over budget. If the project goes from profitable to breakeven at a 10% overrun, the margin was never real.

**Time cost of capital.** Money has a cost. A project that takes 18 months longer than planned does not just lose 18 months of your time. It costs you 18 months of interest on your drawn capital, 18 months of holding costs, and the opportunity cost of that capital being tied up in a project that is not generating returns.

**Infrastructure charges and DA costs.** These are consistently underestimated. On the Sunshine Coast, infrastructure charges alone can run $28,000 to $35,000 per dwelling. On a six-unit townhouse project, that is $168,000 to $210,000 before you have built anything. DA lodgement fees, consultant reports for information requests, and amended application costs add another layer.

## The problem with generic feasibility templates

There are plenty of feasibility spreadsheets available online. Some are quite sophisticated. The problem is not the maths. The maths is straightforward. The problem is the inputs.

A generic template does not know that your site has a 12% cross-fall that will add $150,000 in retaining walls. It does not know that the flood overlay affects the rear 30% of the parcel, which is exactly where your driveway needs to go. It does not know that comparable townhouse sales in that suburb have been trending 8% below the suburb median because the local estate has a reputation for poor build quality.

The value of a site-specific feasibility assessment is not in the calculation engine. It is in the data that feeds the calculation. Planning controls, site geometry, overlay interactions, local construction cost benchmarks, comparable transaction data, council decision patterns. These are the inputs that turn a generic spreadsheet into a decision-making tool.

## When to get a feasibility done (and when not to)

Not every site needs a formal feasibility assessment. If you are looking at a straightforward house-and-land package in an established estate with clear design guidelines, you probably do not need one. The numbers are relatively predictable.

But if you are looking at an infill site, a site with overlays, a site where the zoning permits multiple dwelling types, or a site where you are planning to spend more than $500,000 on land alone, the cost of a proper feasibility assessment is trivial compared to the risk of proceeding without one.

Our assessments start at $8,000 and are delivered in five to seven business days. That is the cost of a bad weekend in a project that runs off the rails. And unlike [engaging three separate consultants](/articles/why-three-consultants-cost-more-than-one-integrated-assessment) over eight weeks, you get an integrated assessment that accounts for the interactions between planning, architecture, and financial viability.
`,

'sunshine-coast-infill-development-the-next-five-years': `
The Sunshine Coast is one of the fastest-growing regions in Australia. The numbers are not ambiguous. The council's own planning documents anticipate 84,800 additional dwellings by 2046, with approximately 60% required to be delivered through infill development on existing urban land. That is roughly 50,000 new dwellings on sites that are currently occupied by detached houses, light industrial uses, or underutilised commercial properties.

This is not a projection that might happen. The population growth is already here. The infrastructure is being built. The planning scheme has been written to accommodate it. The only variable is who captures the value.

## Where the opportunity is concentrated

Not all infill sites are equal. The best opportunities sit at the intersection of three factors: favourable zoning, limited site constraints, and strong end-market demand.

On the Sunshine Coast, that intersection currently points to a handful of corridors. The coastal strip from Caloundra to Maroochydore, where medium density residential zoning permits townhouses and low-rise apartments. The Maroochydore city centre, where the local plan anticipates significant density increases. And the suburban ring around Buderim, Sippy Downs, and Palmview, where larger lots in established suburbs are becoming economically viable for subdivision or multi-dwelling development.

Each of these corridors has different planning controls, different market dynamics, and different risk profiles. A site in Mooloolaba has a very different buyer profile and achievable sale price compared to a site in Currimundi, even though they might be three kilometres apart.

## The land price question

The fundamental tension in infill development is the relationship between land cost and development yield. As more developers recognise the opportunity, land prices in well-zoned locations have increased significantly. Median house prices on the Sunshine Coast have grown 76% over the past five years. Sites with development potential have grown even faster, because the premium buyers are willing to pay reflects the anticipated development value, not just the existing use value.

This creates a paradox: the longer you wait, the more you know about market conditions, but the more you pay for land. The developers who have done best over the past cycle are the ones who committed early, when land prices were lower relative to end-product values.

The next five years are likely to follow a similar pattern. The sites that are available today at current prices will not be available at those prices in 2028. Construction costs will continue to increase (they always do), but end-product values on the Sunshine Coast are underpinned by genuine demand from population growth, not speculative capital flows.

## What the data tells us about timing

Our system tracks council DA lodgements, approval timelines, construction cost indices, and comparable sales data across the Sunshine Coast. Several patterns are becoming clear.

DA processing times have been increasing. The average time from lodgement to decision for a multi-dwelling project has grown from around four months to closer to seven months over the past two years. This affects project timelines, holding costs, and ultimately the financial viability of marginal projects.

Construction costs have stabilised after the sharp increases of 2022 and 2023, but they have not come down. The new baseline is materially higher than pre-COVID levels, and there is no structural reason to expect a significant reduction.

End-product demand remains strong, particularly for well-located townhouses and low-rise apartments in the $700,000 to $1.1 million range. This is the product type that most infill sites on the Sunshine Coast are best suited to deliver.

## The window is real, and it is narrowing

If you own land on the Sunshine Coast that is zoned for medium or high density development, or if you are looking to acquire a site, the next 12 to 24 months represent a meaningful window. Land is available. Zoning permits the development. The market wants the product. Construction costs have stabilised.

What you need is clarity on whether a specific site works financially, given its planning controls, site constraints, and the realistic cost of delivering the product the market wants. That is exactly what a [feasibility assessment](/development-feasibility-sunshine-coast) provides. Start by checking your site's zoning and overlays with our [free Site Analyser](/site-analyser).

'why-three-consultants-cost-more-than-one-integrated-assessment': `
The traditional approach to development feasibility looks like this: you engage a town planner to assess the planning controls. You engage an architect to produce a concept design. You engage a quantity surveyor or cost consultant to estimate construction costs. Three professionals, three invoices, three reports.

On paper, this sounds thorough. In practice, it is one of the most expensive ways to get a feasibility assessment, and not because of the fees.

## The coordination problem

Each consultant works in their own silo. The planner assesses what the planning scheme permits. The architect designs what they think the site can accommodate. The QS estimates the cost of what the architect has drawn. The problem is that each professional is making assumptions about the other disciplines that may not hold.

The planner might confirm that multiple dwellings are permissible, without flagging that the flood overlay affects 40% of the site and will require the ground floor to be raised 800mm above natural ground level. The architect designs a concept that achieves the setbacks and site coverage requirements, but does not account for the infrastructure easement running through the northern boundary. The QS costs the design as drawn, without knowing that the design will need to change once the planner's conditions are incorporated.

The result is a set of reports that look comprehensive but do not actually represent a buildable, approvable, financially viable project. When these gaps are discovered (usually during the DA process or early construction), the redesign costs, additional consultant fees, and timeline delays can easily exceed the cost of the original reports several times over.

## What integration actually means

An integrated assessment does not just mean putting three reports between the same covers. It means having the planning analysis, architectural feasibility, and financial modelling informed by the same data set, produced by people who understand all three disciplines simultaneously.

When we assess a site, the planning constraints directly inform the architectural yield study. If there is a height overlay, we model the maximum permissible building envelope, not a theoretical one. If there are setback requirements from a specific overlay code, those are built into the massing study from the start. The financial model then prices the actual buildable outcome, not a hypothetical one.

This means the numbers you receive reflect what can actually be built and approved on that specific site. Not what could theoretically be built if none of the constraints applied.

## The cost comparison

A typical multi-consultant feasibility process on the Sunshine Coast looks something like this: town planner ($8,000 to $15,000), architect concept design ($15,000 to $30,000), quantity surveyor ($5,000 to $12,000). Total: $28,000 to $57,000. Timeframe: four to eight weeks minimum, often longer.

Our integrated assessments start at $8,000 and are delivered in five to seven business days. The price difference is significant, but the real saving is in accuracy. When the planning, architectural, and financial analysis are integrated from the start, there are no gaps between disciplines for costly surprises to hide in.

## When do you still need separate consultants?

We are not suggesting that planners, architects, and QS professionals are unnecessary. Once a project moves past the feasibility stage into the detailed design and DA preparation phase, you absolutely need specialist consultants in each discipline.

But at the feasibility stage, when the question is "should we proceed with this site?", an integrated assessment gives you a more accurate answer, faster, and for less money than the traditional three-consultant approach. It is the difference between getting a definitive go or no-go recommendation in a week, and spending two months and $50,000 to arrive at the same conclusion.

'how-overlays-quietly-kill-development-margins': `
A site can look perfect on paper. Good zoning. Reasonable land price. Strong comparable sales in the suburb. A yield study that shows eight townhouses at a healthy margin. Then you run the overlays.

The flood map shows the rear third of the site sits within the 1% AEP (annual exceedance probability) flood extent. The bushfire hazard layer indicates a medium risk classification on the northern boundary. And there is a scenic amenity overlay that restricts building height on the street frontage to two storeys, when your feasibility was modelled on three.

None of these constraints are visible from a site inspection. They do not appear on the zoning map. And they can each add tens of thousands of dollars to your development costs, reduce your yield, or both.

## The real cost of overlays

Overlays affect development in three ways: they increase the cost of reports and approvals, they increase construction costs, and they reduce the buildable area or yield.

**Report and approval costs.** A flood overlay typically requires a hydraulic report, a flood risk management study, and potentially a stormwater management plan. Combined cost: $15,000 to $40,000 depending on the complexity. A bushfire overlay requires a bushfire management plan and potentially upgraded construction to BAL-29 or BAL-40. That is another $8,000 to $15,000 in reports, plus the construction cost increase.

**Construction cost increases.** BAL-rated construction (bushfire attack level) adds $15,000 to $40,000 per dwelling depending on the rating. Flood-resilient construction (raised floor levels, specific materials, drainage infrastructure) adds $20,000 to $60,000 per dwelling. Acoustic overlays near transport corridors require upgraded glazing and wall assemblies that can add $8,000 to $15,000 per dwelling.

**Yield reduction.** This is often the biggest impact, and the hardest to quantify without detailed analysis. A heritage overlay might restrict demolition of an existing structure, reducing the developable area. A scenic amenity overlay might cap building height below what the zone otherwise permits, reducing the number of storeys and therefore the number of dwellings. A flood overlay might push the building footprint into a smaller portion of the site, changing the geometry of the whole project.

## The stacking problem

The Sunshine Coast has some of the most overlay-dense areas in Queensland. It is not unusual for a single site to be affected by three, four, or five overlays simultaneously. Each overlay has its own assessment criteria, its own report requirements, and its own cost implications. But the costs do not simply add together. They interact.

A site with both a flood overlay and a steep slope might require retaining walls to create a flat building pad above the flood level, combined with an engineered stormwater system that accounts for both the overland flow path and the site's gradient. The combined cost of addressing both constraints simultaneously is often greater than the sum of addressing each one independently.

## How to protect yourself

The only protection against overlay risk is information. Specifically, you need to know exactly which overlays affect your site, what they require, and how they interact with each other and with the proposed development, before you commit capital.

This is not something you can do with a quick search on the council's mapping tool. The council's PD Online system shows which overlays affect a parcel, but it does not tell you what those overlays mean for your specific development scenario. That requires cross-referencing the overlay mapping with the planning scheme's overlay codes, the state planning policy, and local precedent from recent council decisions on similar sites.

Our system queries every relevant spatial database and cross-references the results against the full suite of planning scheme provisions. When we report that a site has three overlays, we also report the estimated cost impact, the likely report requirements, and whether the constraints are manageable or project-threatening. That distinction is worth far more than the cost of the assessment. You can check overlays on any Sunshine Coast site instantly using our [free Site Analyser](/site-analyser), or read more about [the Sunshine Coast Planning Scheme](/articles/sunshine-coast-planning-scheme-what-developers-miss) and its layered controls.

'sunshine-coast-townhouse-development-what-you-need-to-know': `
Townhouses are the workhorse of infill development on the Sunshine Coast. They sit in the sweet spot between what the planning scheme encourages, what the construction industry can deliver efficiently, and what buyers actually want to purchase. But the economics are tighter than most people assume, and getting the numbers wrong on a townhouse project is easier than it looks.

The buyer pool for Sunshine Coast townhouses is genuine and deep. Owner-occupiers (downsizers, young families, and first-home buyers) make up the majority of purchasers, with investors accounting for a smaller but consistent portion. This matters because owner-occupier demand is more resilient through market cycles than investor demand. It also means design quality and livability affect sale prices more directly than they do for purely investor-grade product.

## The numbers you need to understand

A typical townhouse project on the Sunshine Coast in 2026 looks something like this. Land cost for a medium density residential site ranges from $800,000 to $1.5 million depending on location, size, and constraints. Construction costs for quality townhouses sit between $2,800 and $3,400 per square metre, depending on the specification, site difficulty, and builder. Infrastructure charges run $28,000 to $35,000 per dwelling. Professional fees (planning, design, engineering, project management) add another $80,000 to $150,000 for the project.

End-product values for well-located three-bedroom townhouses range from $750,000 to $1.1 million depending on the suburb, finish level, and proximity to amenity. Two-bedroom product sits lower, typically $550,000 to $750,000, and four-bedroom or premium end-units can exceed $1.2 million in strong locations.

The margin between these cost inputs and revenue outputs is real, but it is not generous. A development margin of 18% to 22% on cost is a reasonable expectation for a well-executed project. But that margin can evaporate quickly if construction runs over budget, if the product type does not match what the local market wants, or if [overlays add unexpected costs](/articles/how-overlays-quietly-kill-development-margins).

## Product mix is where the value is created

The difference between a 15% margin and a 25% margin on a townhouse project often comes down to product mix, not construction cost savings. Getting the right combination of dwelling sizes, bedroom counts, and configuration for the specific suburb is the single highest-leverage decision in the pre-development phase.

A site in Caloundra might achieve the best returns with three-bedroom, two-bathroom townhouses aimed at downsizers. The same site geometry in Sippy Downs might need a mix of three and four-bedroom product aimed at young families near the university. Mooloolaba could support two-bedroom premium units targeting lifestyle buyers and retirees.

These are not decisions you can make from a generic feasibility template. They require local market intelligence: what is selling, at what price, how quickly, and to whom. This is the kind of analysis our system produces, calibrating revenue projections against actual comparable transaction data for the specific suburb and product type.

## Site selection is the foundation

Not every medium density zoned site on the Sunshine Coast makes a good townhouse development. The sites that work share several characteristics: adequate street frontage for driveway access, manageable topography (steep sites add $100,000+ in retaining and civil works), limited overlay exposure, and a geometry that allows efficient building layout.

Sites that look cheap often look cheap for a reason. A narrow site might force single-loaded corridor access that wastes buildable area. A site with a significant cross-fall might require engineered retaining that blows out the civil works budget. A site with flood or bushfire overlays might need additional reports and construction upgrades that add $30,000 to $60,000 per dwelling.

The best approach is to [understand the full picture before committing](/articles/most-development-mistakes-happen-before-you-break-ground): planning controls, site constraints, construction costs, and market dynamics. That is what a feasibility assessment provides, and on a townhouse project where the margins are tight, the cost of getting it wrong dwarfs the cost of getting proper analysis done upfront.

'infrastructure-charges-sunshine-coast-the-hidden-cost': `
If you have ever modelled a development project on the Sunshine Coast and been surprised by the final cost summary, there is a good chance infrastructure charges were the culprit. They are one of the most consistently underestimated line items in early-stage feasibility, and on a multi-dwelling project, they can represent a significant chunk of your total project cost.

Infrastructure charges (sometimes called infrastructure contributions or development charges) are levied by Sunshine Coast Council to fund the roads, water, sewerage, stormwater, and community infrastructure required to service new development. They are calculated on a per-dwelling or per-lot basis, and the rates are set by the council's adopted charges resolution.

## What the numbers actually look like

On the Sunshine Coast in 2026, infrastructure charges for a new dwelling typically range from $28,000 to $35,000, depending on the specific location and the type of development. The charge comprises several components: transport network, water supply, sewerage, stormwater, and parks and community facilities.

On a six-unit townhouse project, that translates to $168,000 to $210,000. On a twelve-unit apartment project, $336,000 to $420,000. These are not trivial sums. They are payable before construction begins (typically at the time of DA approval or prior to building approval), which means they hit your cash flow at a point when you have already spent significantly on land, design, and approvals.

The charges are not negotiable in most cases. Council applies the adopted charges resolution consistently. The only offsets available are for existing lawful uses on the site (if you are demolishing an existing house to build townhouses, you receive a credit for the one dwelling). This credit reduces the charges, but only by one dwelling's worth.

## Why they get underestimated

The most common reason infrastructure charges are underestimated is that developers use outdated figures or generic estimates from other council areas. Each council in Queensland sets its own charges, and the Sunshine Coast charges are higher than many people expect, particularly compared to some Brisbane-area councils.

Another issue is that some feasibility models simply omit infrastructure charges entirely, or bundle them into a general "council costs" line item that is set too low. We regularly see preliminary feasibility models that allocate $10,000 to $15,000 per dwelling for "council costs" when the actual infrastructure charges alone exceed that figure before you add DA lodgement fees, planning certificates, and other statutory costs.

## How they affect project viability

On a townhouse project where the target development margin is 20%, infrastructure charges can represent the difference between a viable project and a marginal one. Consider a project with a $3.5 million total development cost and an expected revenue of $4.2 million. The gross margin is $700,000, or 20%.

Now add $50,000 in underestimated infrastructure charges (the difference between a rough estimate and the actual figure). That margin drops to $650,000, or 18.6%. On a project with a two-year timeline, that 1.4% margin compression translates directly to reduced return on capital. And infrastructure charges are just one of several costs that tend to be underestimated in early-stage analysis.

This is why we quantify infrastructure charges precisely in every [feasibility assessment](/development-feasibility-sunshine-coast) we produce. We cross-reference the adopted charges resolution against the proposed development to calculate the exact charge payable, including any credits for existing uses. No estimates. No round numbers. The actual figure your project will need to budget for.

## How to account for them properly

If you are modelling a development on the Sunshine Coast, the adopted charges resolution is publicly available on the council's website. Look up the specific charges for your development type and location. Do not use generic figures or averages from other council areas.

Factor the charges into your cash flow model at the point they are payable (typically pre-construction), not as a general project cost spread across the timeline. This matters for your funding structure and interest cost calculations.

And remember that infrastructure charges are just one component of the statutory cost envelope. DA lodgement fees, planning and compliance certificates, engineering certifications, and operational works approvals all add to the pre-construction cost base. A thorough [feasibility analysis](/articles/queensland-development-feasibility-what-the-numbers-need-to-show) accounts for all of these.

'buying-a-development-site-sunshine-coast-due-diligence-checklist': `
Buying a development site is the single largest financial commitment in any property development project. It is also the point where the most value is created or destroyed. Once you sign the contract, your negotiating leverage disappears and your capital is committed. Everything that follows, design, approvals, construction, sales, is constrained by the site you chose and the price you paid for it.

This checklist covers the key items to verify before committing to a development site on the Sunshine Coast. It is not exhaustive (every site has its own peculiarities), but it covers the issues that most commonly catch developers off guard.

## Planning and zoning

**Verify the zone, not just the zoning map.** Check the actual planning scheme zone code, not just the colour on the map. Confirm that your intended use (e.g. multiple dwellings, dual occupancy, apartments) is listed as accepted, code assessable, or impact assessable in that zone. Some uses that seem logical for a zone are actually impact assessable or inconsistent with the zone purpose, which dramatically changes the approval risk.

**Check for local plan provisions.** Several areas on the Sunshine Coast are subject to local plans (Caloundra South, Maroochydore, Mooloolaba, and others) that override or supplement the general zone provisions. A site in a local plan area may have completely different height limits, setback requirements, and density expectations compared to identically zoned land elsewhere.

**Map every overlay.** Run the site against the council's overlay mapping and the state government's spatial databases. Flood, bushfire, landslide, acid sulfate soils, heritage, building height, scenic amenity, and other overlays can all affect your site. Each overlay has cost implications. Our [article on overlays](/articles/how-overlays-quietly-kill-development-margins) covers this in detail.

**Understand the assessment pathway.** Is your proposed development code assessable or impact assessable? Code assessable applications are assessed against the codes without public notification. Impact assessable applications include public notification and are subject to third-party submitter rights, which can add months to the approval timeline and introduce uncertainty.

## Site and physical constraints

**Commission a survey early.** You need accurate site dimensions, levels, and boundary locations. Many site acquisition decisions are made on the basis of approximate measurements from aerial imagery. A formal survey often reveals boundary discrepancies, easements, or level changes that affect the development yield.

**Assess the topography.** Slope affects construction costs significantly. A site with a cross-fall greater than 5% will require retaining walls or cut-and-fill earthworks that can add $100,000 or more to the project. A site with a slope greater than 15% may be unsuitable for the intended product type altogether.

**Check for easements and encumbrances.** Drainage easements, sewer easements, electricity easements, and right-of-way easements can all restrict where you can build. These are recorded on the title but are easy to overlook in the excitement of a site acquisition. An easement running through the middle of the site can fundamentally change the building layout.

**Investigate services capacity.** Confirm that water, sewer, stormwater, and electricity services are available to the site and have sufficient capacity for the intended development. In some growth areas or fringe locations, service augmentation may be required at the developer's cost.

## Financial due diligence

**Get a realistic construction cost estimate.** Use local Sunshine Coast benchmarks, not national averages. Construction costs vary significantly by location, site difficulty, and current market conditions. A feasibility model built on generic cost rates will give you a false sense of the margin.

**Quantify the infrastructure charges.** As discussed in our [article on infrastructure charges](/articles/infrastructure-charges-sunshine-coast-the-hidden-cost), these can run $28,000 to $35,000 per dwelling on the Sunshine Coast. On a multi-unit project, this is a material cost item that must be accurately budgeted.

**Model the revenue conservatively.** Use comparable sales data from the same suburb and product type, not aspirational pricing from premium locations. Test what happens to your margin if sale prices come in 5% or 10% below expectation. If the project only works at the top of the market, it does not work.

## Contract conditions

**Include adequate due diligence periods.** A standard 14-day due diligence period is rarely sufficient for a development site. You need time to conduct searches, commission a survey, assess overlays, and ideally obtain a preliminary [feasibility assessment](/development-feasibility-sunshine-coast). Negotiate for 21 to 30 days minimum.

**Make the contract conditional on satisfactory planning assessment.** This gives you the ability to walk away if the planning investigation reveals constraints that materially affect the development potential. The wording matters. Work with a solicitor experienced in development site acquisitions.

**Understand the settlement timeline.** Longer settlement periods give you more time to advance design and approvals before committing the balance of the purchase price. But they also mean longer holding costs on any deposit or option fee. Model both scenarios.

The common thread across all of these items is information. The developers who consistently make good site acquisition decisions are the ones who invest in understanding the full picture before they commit. A [feasibility assessment](/services#feasibility) is the most efficient way to get that picture.

'da-approval-sunshine-coast-what-to-expect': `
The development application (DA) process on the Sunshine Coast is where planning theory meets administrative reality. It is the point where your site analysis, design, and financial modelling are tested against the council's interpretation of the planning scheme. Understanding how this process actually works, not just how it is supposed to work, can save you months and tens of thousands of dollars.

## The assessment pathways

Sunshine Coast Council assesses development applications under the Planning Act 2016. There are two primary assessment pathways for most development types: code assessment and impact assessment.

**Code assessment** applies to development that is listed as code assessable in the relevant zone. The application is assessed against the applicable codes (zone code, overlay codes, development codes) without public notification. Code assessable applications are generally faster and more predictable, but compliance with the codes is still required. Council does not have discretion to approve non-compliant applications without the applicant demonstrating that alternative solutions achieve the purpose of the relevant code.

**Impact assessment** applies to development that is listed as impact assessable. The process includes public notification (minimum 15 business days), the ability for third parties to lodge submissions, and council has broader discretion in its assessment. Impact assessable applications are inherently more uncertain, take longer, and are more expensive. If your proposed development triggers impact assessment, build additional time and cost into your project plan.

## Realistic timelines

The statutory timeframes for DA assessment are well defined, but the actual timelines on the Sunshine Coast consistently exceed them. Here is what we are seeing in practice for multi-dwelling residential development:

**Code assessable applications:** Statutory assessment period is 25 business days from the date the application is properly made. In practice, most applications receive an information request within the first 15 business days, which stops the assessment clock. The applicant then has time to respond (typically 3 to 8 weeks depending on the complexity of the information requested). After the response is submitted, the assessment clock restarts. Total elapsed time from lodgement to decision: typically four to seven months.

**Impact assessable applications:** The process includes a 15 business day public notification period in addition to the assessment period. If submissions are received, the applicant may need to respond to submitter concerns. Total elapsed time: typically six to twelve months, sometimes longer if the application is contentious.

## Information requests: the hidden timeline killer

Information requests are the single biggest source of timeline and cost overruns in the DA process. An information request is council's formal notice that additional information is needed before the application can be assessed. The assessment clock stops when the request is issued and does not restart until a complete response is provided.

Common information request topics on the Sunshine Coast include: stormwater management plans, traffic impact assessments, bushfire management plans, acoustic reports, landscape plans, and design amendments to address specific code provisions.

Each information request adds cost (the reports and consultant fees required to respond) and time (the elapsed time to prepare and submit the response, plus the restarted assessment period). A single information request can add two to four months to the total timeline.

The best way to minimise information requests is to lodge a complete, code-compliant application that addresses every relevant provision. This is where detailed planning knowledge pays for itself. Understanding [what the Sunshine Coast Planning Scheme actually requires](/articles/sunshine-coast-planning-scheme-what-developers-miss) and addressing it proactively in the application is far more efficient than responding to council queries after lodgement.

## The real costs of the DA process

DA lodgement fees on the Sunshine Coast vary by development type and scale, but for a typical multi-dwelling residential application, expect to pay $8,000 to $20,000 in council application fees. This does not include the cost of preparing the application itself.

A complete DA application for a multi-dwelling project typically requires: town planning report, architectural drawings, landscape plan, civil engineering drawings, stormwater management plan, and potentially bushfire, acoustic, ecological, or heritage reports depending on the overlays that affect the site. The total cost of preparing these documents ranges from $30,000 to $80,000 depending on the complexity of the site and the number of overlays.

If you receive information requests and need to engage additional consultants or amend existing reports, add another $10,000 to $30,000 to the professional fees.

## How to position yourself for a smooth approval

The developers who consistently achieve faster approvals on the Sunshine Coast share a common approach: they invest heavily in the pre-application phase. They understand the planning controls before they lodge. They address every applicable code provision in the application. They anticipate the issues council is likely to raise and provide the supporting documentation upfront.

This is the value of [pre-development management](/services#management). Having someone who knows the Sunshine Coast council process, who has seen what triggers information requests, and who can prepare an application that addresses the assessment criteria comprehensively, is the most effective way to minimise the time and cost of the DA process.
